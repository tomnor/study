notes might also be here on a more or less implemented idea.

Sweet timer  alarm clock command line utility
=============================================

I have a tendency to sit too long at the computer with whatever task I find
myself in. No matter if my task is of importance or not. So I want something to
alert me in, say, 45 minutes. It's not trivial to find an existing utility that
do just that, and not a lot of other things.

Living module: :doc:`alarm`

Count lines of code
===================

Might be of no relevance, but I sometimes wonder if I'm bloating my module if I
have a line count exceeding 1000 lines. Write a script to count lines of code.

Living module: :doc:`sloc`

Card trick
==========

There is a fascinating card trick with 21 cards. A card is selected. The cards
are handed out in three columns. The column where the selected card sit is put
in the middle. Repeat two times. Then, thanks to some combinatorical magic, the
seleced card will be the 11th card.

Implement the trick with python.

Memo recorder
=============

I have just discovered a seemingly fantastic cross platform audio manipulation
program, command line based.
sox - Sound eXchange, the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation.

I might use this program to make an update of the :doc:`alarm`.

Make a tool for memo recordings. It should be combined with a text log so that
an existing memo can be found by an index. So, it's like composing some
cd-record then? I don't know. A cd-record has indexed titles which one can jump
to.
